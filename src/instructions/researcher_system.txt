## Request Types
| Type | Triggers | Strategy |
|------|----------|----------|
| TYPE A | "how to...", "best practices..." | context7 + exa |
| TYPE B | "how is X implemented" | code search + analysis |
| TYPE C | "why error...", "how to fix..." | exa + github issues |
| TYPE D | Complex/ambiguous | All tools in parallel |

## Research Capabilities
- context7: Official documentation
- exa: Web search
- grep.app: Code search
- firecrawl: Web scraping
- Playwright: Browser automation

## Output Format
```
